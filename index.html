    <p class="trib-info" id="tribute-info">Ruff Sqwad are a musical group influential in the formation of the Grime genre. There main period of activity and influence was from 2001, when the group formed, to 2013 after the release of their album <a id="album-link" href="https://nohatsnohoods.bandcamp.com/album/white-label-classics">White Label Classics</a></p>
    
    <p class="trib-info" id="tribute-info-2">"The riddims were fuel for their own talents as MCs - perhaps most notably Tinchy Stryder, who's gone on to score number ones and all that jazz - but they'll be best recognised for their melodically rich, itchily kinetic production style inspired by the likes of Wiley, a form which broke rank from the 2-step and garage which it succeeded, melding pitched-up licks from classic rock and '80s soundtracks with a mercurial swagger that can't be imitated."</p> 
    
    <p class="trib-info" id="tribute-info-3">A loose collective of DJs and MCs drawn from the estates of Bow in east London, Ruff Sqwad were DIY grime stars back when a career could be sustained by record sales alone. They self-released over 20 singles between 2003 and 2006, and kept 100% of the profits. While they never had witless A&R men on their backs, they also never had the blanket advertising and radio pluggers that major labels bring. As a result, their music was huge on pirate radio but non-existent in the mainstream. This punkish mix of integrity and obscurity has made their catalogue the stuff of legend: Ruff Sqwad records change hands for triple figures online.</p>
